This is a rough transcript and the slides of the lightening talk about sleep.


## rough transcript  

You know last night…
When i was trying to prepare the talk and didn't really know what I should talk about
and it was kinda getting late...

There was one important thing that occurred to me....

....

### sleep
So I decided to talk about sleep.

....


#### sleep duration
As y ou might now from your own experience
Most of people sleep between 7 and 8 hours

But sleep duration varies between people, some only sleep 4 others up to 10 h per night

And it doesn't only vary between people it also varies over time

....

#### sleep over life span
Newborns sleep 2/3 of day
Older people need less than 6 hours

There different stages of sleep

Yellow : percentage of REM (rapid eye movements)
Green: non-REM or slow wave sleep

....

### sleep cycles

And over the night we go through up to 5 cycles of theses stages
From wake to deep sleep to REM to deep sleep to REM

And as you see in graph
It is also normal to wake up at night
Most if the time we don't remember that we woke up


Ok so we already know that we sleep a lot
1/3 of life

And that sleep is important
< 4h is considered harmful
And 3 days without sleep -> lethal (at least mice, we don't know about people)

one question remains.

....

### why do we sleep?

The answer is (as so often in psychology)
Nobody knows

...

But we do know that it is essential for learning

The sws is important for

...

### learning
Consolidation of explicit memory
Exp mem are all the facts we remember
What, when where?
What you learn in school

If you wonder about the brain in the slide

For one reason the blue part (hippocampus ) is the brain structure involved in
Forming explicate memeory

But more importantly
Research shows that talks with pics of brains are more convincing

So if nothing convinced you so far, this should.

....

### learning
Back to sleep
The REM phase is also important for learning

During REM procedural learning happens
Procedural memories is everything which you can do, but you have no ides how you are doing it
Thinks like walking, talking, riding a bike etc

But during REM there is also something else happening

....

### dreams
If you say, you are one of the people who don't dream

...

Well, everyone dreams

But most of the time people don't remember

We only remember dreams from the last two sleeping cycles

And if you think well dreams,
Those are all the surpressed desires
And everything else you are busy trying to forget during the day

well, there is

...

No evidence for that

There are however theories which explain sleep and one of them

...

### activation-synthesis theory
Is called activation-synthesis theory (Hobson)

It says dreams are just random activation in the brain stem,
Which is forwarded to the cortex

Where it is interpreted just like input from our senses would.

So dreams are basically the interpretation of the random activation patterns

...

### thx
So thank you for listening
And keep dreaming
